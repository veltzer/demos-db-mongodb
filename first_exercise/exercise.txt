- Run mongodb on your linux machine using *docker* (not any other way).
	Search dockerhub for mongodb images.
	Follow the instructions there about how to correctly run mongodb.
	Take care to open the right ports so that you could connect to mongodb.
	- make sure that mongo is running using various methods:
		- ps -ef
		- docker ps
		- sudo netstat -ln | grep [port_number]
		- telnet localhost [port_number]

- Write a python script that does two things:
	1. insert one document (document=piece of data in mongo speak) into the database.
	2. show all pieces of data in the database.
	You will need to take care of:
	- you will need to create a database and a collection within the database.
	- you will need to install various python module(s) to talk to mongodb.
	- only after the previous two will you be able to insert data into the mongodb.
	make sure that your script(s) work.

- write a script called "delete_all_data.py" which deleted all documents from your collection.
	check that it works using the previous "show_all_data.py" script.

- Write a new python script called "import_csv.py" which can import the movie
	data from "movies.csv" file.
	Only import two fields from the csv: the name of the movie and it's description.
	Insert them as documents of the following form:
		{ "name": "{movie_name}", "description": "{movie_description}" }
	After import check that indeed all the data was correctly imported into the database
	by running the "show_data.py" script from the previous phase. You should see 49 movies.

	hints:
	- you will need to use a python module that can correctly read a csv file.
	- you will need to find the right column numbers for the data that you need (the movie name
	and it's description)
