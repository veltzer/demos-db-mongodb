- Run mongodb on your linux machine using *docker* (not any other way).
	Search dockerhub for mongodb images.
	Follow the instructions there about how to correctly run mongodb.
	Take care to open the right ports so that you could connect to mongodb.
	- make sure that mongo is running using various methods:
		- ps -ef
		- docker ps
		- netstat

- Write a python script that does two things:
	1. insert one document (document=piece of data in mongo speak) into the database.
	2. show all pieces of data in the database.
	You will need to take care of:
	- you will need to create a database and a collection within the database.
	- you will need to install various python module(s) to talk to mongodb.
	- only after the previous two will you be able to insert data into the mongodb.
	make sure that your script(s) work.
